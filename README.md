## Description

The purpose of this project is to understand what variables influence university drop out among freshmen.
We consider variables like ECTS gained in the first semester, GPA in the first semester, income, high school final grade and other numerical and categorical variables.
The source code provided here is designed to perform various analyses and statistical calculations.

Final grade: 4/4
